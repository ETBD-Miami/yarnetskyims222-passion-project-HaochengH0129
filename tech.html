                <h1> The Technology Applied in Formula One</h1>
                <div class="background information">
                    <p>A Formula One car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel formula
                        racing car with substantial front and rear wings, and an engine positioned behind the driver,
                        intended to be used in competition at Formula One racing events. The regulations governing the
                        cars are unique to the championship and specify that cars must be constructed by the racing
                        teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be outsourced. Formula One cars are
                        the fastest cars in the world around a race track, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved
                        through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. As a result of the amount
                        of braking force and the total cornering envelope of a Formula One car (by the friction
                        component of the tyre, the mass of the machine and the downforce generated); Formula One
                        drivers experience frequent lateral g-loadings in excess of 5 g, and peak cornering forces of
                        up to 7 lateral g.</p>
                    <p>Modern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open wheel single-seaters.
                        The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff
                        and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 795 kg (1,753 lb) –
                        the minimum weight set by the regulations. If the construction of the car is lighter than
                        the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage
                        of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the
                        centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="chassis design" <h3 id="t1">Chassis design</h3>
                    <p>Modern-day Formula One cars are constructed from composites of carbon fibre and similar
                        ultra-lightweight materials. The minimum weight permissible is 740 kg (1,631 lb) including
                        the driver but not fuel. Cars are weighed with dry-weather tyres fitted. Prior to the 2014 F1
                        season, cars often weighed in under this limit so teams added ballast in order to add weight to
                        the car. The advantage of using ballast is that it can be placed anywhere in the car to provide
                        ideal weight distribution. This can help lower the car's centre of gravity to improve stability
                        and also allows the team to fine-tune the weight distribution of the car to suit individual
                        circuits.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="engines">

                    <h3 id="t2">Engines</h3>
                    <p>The 2006 Formula One season saw the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) introduce a
                        then-new engine formula, which mandated cars to be powered by 2.4 L naturally aspirated engines
                        in the V8 engine configuration, with no more than four valves per cylinder.[10] Further
                        technical restrictions, such as a ban on variable intake trumpets, have also been introduced
                        with the new 2.4 L V8 formula to prevent the teams from achieving higher RPM and horsepower too
                        quickly. The 2009 season limited engines to 18,000 rpm in order to improve engine reliability
                        and cut costs.</p>

                    <p>For a decade, F1 cars had run with 3.0 L naturally aspirated engines with all teams settling on
                        a V10 layout by the end of the period; however, development had led to these engines producing
                        between 730 and 750 kW (980 and 1,000 hp), and the cars reaching top speeds of 375 km/h (233
                        mph) (Jacques Villeneuve with Sauber-Ferrari) on the Monza circuit.[12] Teams started to use
                        exotic alloys in the late 1990s, leading to the FIA banning the use of exotic materials in
                        engine construction, with only aluminium, titanium and iron alloys being allowed for the
                        pistons, cylinders, connecting rods and crankshafts. The FIA has continually enforced
                        material and design restrictions to limit power. Even with the restrictions, the V10s in the
                        2005 season were reputed to develop 730 kW (980 hp), power levels not seen since before the ban
                        on turbo-charged engines in 1989.</p>

                    <p>The lesser funded teams (the former Minardi team spent less than 50 million, while Ferrari spent
                        hundreds of millions of euros a year developing their car) had the option of keeping the current
                        V10 for another season, but with a rev limiter to keep them competitive with the most powerful
                        V8 engines. The only team to take this option was the Toro Rosso team, which was reformed and
                        regrouped Minardi.</p>

                    <p>In 2012, the engines consumed around 450 l (16 cu ft) of air per second (at the 2012 rev limit
                        of 18,000 rpm); race fuel consumption rate was normally around 75 l/100 km (3.8 mpg‑imp; 3.1
                        mpg‑US).</p>

                    <p>All cars have the engine located between the driver and the rear axle. The engines are a
                        stressed member in most cars, meaning that the engine is part of the structural support
                        framework, being bolted to the cockpit at the front end, and transmission and rear suspension at
                        the back end.</p>

                    <p>In the 2004 championship, engines were required to last a full race weekend. For the 2005
                        championship, they were required to last two full race weekends and if a team changes an engine
                        between the two races, they incur a penalty of 10 grid positions. In 2007, this rule was altered
                        slightly and an engine only had to last for Saturday and Sunday running. This was to promote
                        Friday running. In the 2008 season, engines were required to last two full race weekends; the
                        same regulation as the 2006 season. However, for the 2009 season, drivers were allowed to use a
                        maximum of 8 engines per head over the season, meaning that a couple of engines had to last
                        three race weekends. This method of limiting engine costs also increases the importance of
                        tactics, since the teams have to choose which races to have a new or an already-used engine.</p>

                    <p>As of the 2014 season, all F1 cars have been equipped with turbocharged 1.6 L V6 engines.
                        Turbochargers had previously been banned since 1989. This change may give an improvement of up
                        to 29% fuel efficiency.[14] One of the many reasons that Mercedes dominated the season early,
                        was due to the placement of the turbocharger's compressor at one side of the engine, and the
                        turbine at the other; both were then linked by a shaft travelling through the vee of the engine.
                        The benefit is that air is not traveling through as much pipework, in turn reducing turbo lag
                        and increasing the efficiency of the car. In addition, it means that the air moving through the
                        compressor is much cooler since it is farther away from the hot turbine section.[15]</p>
                    <h4>2022 and beyond</h4>
                    <p>In 2017, the FIA began negotiations with existing constructors and potential new manufacturers
                        over the next generation of engines with a projected introduction date of 2021 but delayed to
                        2022 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] The initial proposal was designed to
                        simplify engine designs, cut costs, promote new entries and address criticisms directed at the
                        2014 generation of engines. It called for the 1.6 L V6 configuration to be retained, but
                        abandoned the complex Motor Generator Unit–Heat (MGU-H) system.[64] The Motor Generator
                        Unit–Kinetic (MGU-K) would be more powerful, with a greater emphasis on driver deployment and a
                        more flexible introduction to allow for tactical use. The proposal also called for the
                        introduction of standardised components and design parameters to make components produced by all
                        manufacturers compatible with one another in a system dubbed "plug in and play".[64] A further
                        proposal to allow four-wheel drive cars was also made, with the front axle driven by an MGU-K
                        unit—as opposed to the traditional driveshaft—that functioned independently of the MGU-K
                        providing power to the rear axle, mirroring the system developed by Porsche for the 919 Hybrid
                        race car.</p>

                    <p>However, mostly due to no engine supplier applying for F1 entry in 2021 and 2022, 1. Abolishment
                        of MGU-H, 2. More powerful MGU-K, and 3. Four-wheel drive system, were all shelved with the
                        possibility of their re-introduction for 2026. Instead, the teams and FIA agreed to a radical
                        change in body/chassis aerodynamics to promote more battles on the course at closer distances to
                        each other. They further agreed to an increase in Alcohol content from 5.75% to 10% of fuel, and
                        to implement a freeze on power unit design for 2023-2025 with a specification to be determined
                        during the 2022 season.[67] Honda, the outgoing engine supplier in 2021, was keen to keep the
                        MGU-H, and Red Bull, who took over the engine production project, backed that opinion.[68] The
                        4WD system was planned to be based on Porsche 919 Hybrid system,[65] but Porsche ended up not
                        becoming an F1 engine supplier for 2021-2022.</p>
                    <h4>Banning Refuelling</h4>
                    <p>In order to reduce the cost and also to increase safety, the FIA decided to ban it. So the F1 On
                        race cars will follow the recent regulation that will enhance the race with a full tank of fuel.
                        Prior to the ban, there were just one too many incidents in the pit lane that were caused by
                        refueling. Fuel spillage, on several occasions, led to the cars going up in flames. Hence, the
                        safety factor was one of the major reasons for F1’s decision to ban refueling.

                        The other reason being cost-cutting. Back then, every penny counted, and hence, moving heavy
                        fueling equipment from one Grand Prix to another would lead to much bigger freight charges.</p>

                <p>A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to
                    compete
                    regularly, he was never able to win the world championship and has been described by The
                    Independent as "The
                    greatest driver to never win the world championship". In a seven-year span between 1955 and
                    1961, Moss
                    finished as championship runner-up four times and in third place the other three times.
                    Fangio,
                    however, achieved the record of winning 24 of the 52 races he entered - a record that holds
                    to
                    this day.
                    National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.
                    Non-championship Formula
                    One events were held by promoters for many years. However, due to the increasing cost of
                    competition, the
                    last of these occurred in 1983.</p>

                <P>This period featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Ferrari,
                    Mercedes-Benz,
                    and
                    Maserati. The first seasons featured pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined,
                    with
                    narrow
                    tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953
                    World
                    Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to
                    concerns over the
                    lack of Formula One cars available. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to
                    2.5
                    litres
                    was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz introduced the advanced
                    W196.
                    This featured
                    innovations such as desmodromic valves and fuel injection, as well as enclosed streamlined
                    bodywork.
                    Mercedes drivers won the championship for two years, before the team withdrew from all
                    motorsport in the
                    wake of the 1955 Le Mans disaster.</p>

                <h3>Technological Developments</h3>
                <p> The first major technological development, Bugatti's re-introduction of mid-engined cars
                    (following
                    Ferdinand Porsche's pioneering Auto Unions of the 1930s), occurred with the Type 251, which
                    was
                    unsuccessful. Australian Jack Brabham, world champion during 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon
                    proved
                    the
                    mid-engined design's superiority. By 1961, all regular competitors had switched to
                    mid-engined
                    cars. The
                    Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined F1 car to enter a world
                    championship
                    race. It was entered in the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete
                    that
                    year.</p>

                <p> During 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the
                    traditional
                    space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the
                    introduction of
                    mid-engined cars. During 1968, Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette
                    sponsorship
                    on their
                    Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours in the 1968 South
                    African Grand Prix
                    on 1 January 1968, thus introducing sponsorship to the sport.[17] Five months later, Lotus
                    as
                    the first
                    works team followed this example when they painted an Imperial Tobacco livery on their cars
                    in
                    the 1968
                    Spanish Grand Prix.</p>

                <p> Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of
                    aerofoils
                    during the
                    late 1960s. During the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics (previously
                    used
                    on Jim
                    Hall's Chaparral 2J during 1970) that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased
                    cornering speeds.
                    The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's
                    weight. As
                    a result,
                    extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the
                    suspension
                    virtually
                    solid. This meant that the drivers were depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount
                    of
                    cushioning
                    of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.[18]</p>
