                <div class="background information">
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3 id="t1">The Start</h3>
                    <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of
                        the 1920s and
                        1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One
                        was a new
                        formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship races taking place that year.
                        The first
                        Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had
                        laid out rules
                        for a world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the
                        conflict, the
                        World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship
                        race took
                        place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. Giuseppe Farina, in his Alfa Romeo, won the
                        first World
                        Championship for Drivers in 1950, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However,
                        Fangio won
                        the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles
                        stood for 45
                        years until Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was interrupted
                        (after an
                        injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari.</p>

                    <p>A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to
                        compete
                        regularly, he was never able to win the world championship and has been described by The
                        Independent as "The
                        greatest driver to never win the world championship". In a seven-year span between 1955 and
                        1961, Moss
                        finished as championship runner-up four times and in third place the other three times. Fangio,
                        however, achieved the record of winning 24 of the 52 races he entered - a record that holds to
                        this day.
                        National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.
                        Non-championship Formula
                        One events were held by promoters for many years. However, due to the increasing cost of
                        competition, the
                        last of these occurred in 1983.</p>

                    <P>This period featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz,
                        and
                        Maserati. The first seasons featured pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with
                        narrow
                        tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953
                        World
                        Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to
                        concerns over the
                        lack of Formula One cars available. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5
                        litres
                        was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz introduced the advanced W196.
                        This featured
                        innovations such as desmodromic valves and fuel injection, as well as enclosed streamlined
                        bodywork.
                        Mercedes drivers won the championship for two years, before the team withdrew from all
                        motorsport in the
                        wake of the 1955 Le Mans disaster.</p>

                    <hr />

                    <h3 id="t2">Technological Developments</h3>
                    <p> The first major technological development, Bugatti's re-introduction of mid-engined cars
                        (following
                        Ferdinand Porsche's pioneering Auto Unions of the 1930s), occurred with the Type 251, which was
                        unsuccessful. Australian Jack Brabham, world champion during 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved
                        the
                        mid-engined design's superiority. By 1961, all regular competitors had switched to mid-engined
                        cars. The
                        Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined F1 car to enter a world
                        championship
                        race. It was entered in the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that
                        year.</p>

                    <p> During 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the
                        traditional
                        space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the
                        introduction of
                        mid-engined cars. During 1968, Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship
                        on their
                        Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours in the 1968 South
                        African Grand Prix
                        on 1 January 1968, thus introducing sponsorship to the sport.[17] Five months later, Lotus as
                        the first
                        works team followed this example when they painted an Imperial Tobacco livery on their cars in
                        the 1968
                        Spanish Grand Prix.</p>

                    <p> Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils
                        during the
                        late 1960s. During the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics (previously used
                        on Jim
                        Hall's Chaparral 2J during 1970) that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased
                        cornering speeds.
                        The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As
                        a result,
                        extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension
                        virtually
                        solid. This meant that the drivers were depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount of
                        cushioning
                        of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.[18]</p>

                    <h3 id="t3">Big Businesses</h3>
                    <p>Beginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial
                        rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business
                        it now is.[19][20] When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the
                        Formula One Constructors' Association and during 1978, he became its president.[21] Previously,
                        the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually;
                        however, Ecclestone persuaded the teams to "hunt as a pack" through FOCA.[20] He offered Formula
                        One to circuit owners as a package, which they could take or leave. In return for the package,
                        almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.</p>
                    <p>The formation of the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) during 1979 set off the
                        FISA–FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with
                        FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations.[22] The Guardian said that Ecclestone
                        and Max Mosley "used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view". FOCA
                        threatened to establish a rival series, boycotted a Grand Prix and FISA withdrew its sanction
                        from races.[19] The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical
                        stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations.[23] Although FISA
                        asserted its right to the TV revenues, it handed the administration of those rights to FOCA.</p>
                    <p>FISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983.[25] By then, however, turbocharged
                        engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were
                        essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5
                        bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian
                        Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost
                        pressure limited to only 4.0 bar.[26] These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit
                        racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank
                        capacity in 1984, and boost pressures in 1988, before banning turbocharged engines completely in
                        1989</p>
                    <p>The development of electronic driver aids began during the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system
                        of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92.[28] By 1987, this system
                        had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year.
                        In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control
                        were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the
                        outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994 season. This
                        resulted in cars that were previously dependent on electronic aids becoming very "twitchy" and
                        difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they "proved
                        difficult to police effectively".</p>
                    <p>The teams signed a second Concorde Agreement during 1992 and a third in 1997.</p>
                    <p>On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham were also
                        being competitive during the early part of the 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with
                        Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won sixteen championships
                        (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford,
                        Honda, and Renault to also win sixteen titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The
                        rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during 1988 and
                        continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix
                        after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to
                        improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also
                        lost his life in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on
                        the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix,
                        where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying
                        nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have lost their lives, one
                        at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix,[31] the second at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix[31] and the
                        third at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.</p>

                    <p>Since the deaths of Senna and Ratzenberger, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule
                        changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all
                        the teams – most notably the changes introduced for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era
                        resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of
                        grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to
                        produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and
                        track. This, according to the FIA, was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.</p>
                    <p>Results were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers
                        clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the
                        tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking as these
                        devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars
                        from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the
                        track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder
                        compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in
                        times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.</p>

                    <p>Drivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the "Big Four",
                        won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008. The teams won every Constructors' Championship
                        from 1979 to 2008, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors'
                        Championship in every season between 1989 and 1997, and winning every race but one (the 1996
                        Monaco Grand Prix) between 1988 and 1997. Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the
                        cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens.
                        This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as
                        Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive,
                        but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.</p>

                <h3 id="t4">Manufacturers' Return</h3>
                <p>Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000–2004) and six
                    consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999–2004). Schumacher set many new records, including
                    those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (thirteen of
                    eighteen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021).[33]
                    Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso
                    became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and followed by
                    Sebastian Vettel in 2010). During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired
                    at the end of 2006 after sixteen years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010
                    season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.</p>

                <p>During this period, the championship rules were changed frequently by the FIA with the intention of
                    improving the on-track action and cutting costs.[34] Team orders, legal since the championship
                    started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents, in which teams openly
                    manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002
                    Austrian Grand Prix. Other changes included the qualifying format, the points scoring system, the
                    technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A "tyre war"
                    between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall, although, at the 2005 United States
                    Grand Prix at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were
                    deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the
                    2007 season by default. Bridgestone then went on to sign a contract on 20 December 2007 that
                    officially made them the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.</p>

                <p>During 2006, Max Mosley outlined a "green" future for Formula One, in which efficient use of energy
                    would become an important factor.</p>

                <p>Starting in 2000, with Ford's purchase of Stewart Grand Prix to form the Jaguar Racing team, new
                    manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since the departure of Alfa Romeo
                    and Renault at the end of 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams – Renault, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and
                    Ferrari – dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors'
                    Championship. The sole exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by Mercedes-Benz.
                    Through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA), the manufacturers negotiated a larger share
                    of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.</p>

                <h3 id="t5">Manufacturers' Decline and Return of the Privateers</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within the space of a
                    year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance within the
                    sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP with Ross Brawn and
                    Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of
                    employees, but eventually won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original
                    founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team[38] were another, formerly manufacturer-owned
                    team that reverted to "privateer" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii
                    Capital investors. A link with their previous owners still survived, however, with their car
                    continuing to be powered by a Renault Power Unit until 2014.</p>

                <p>McLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz (McLaren's
                    partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the McLaren Mercedes SLR road
                    car project and tough F1 championships which included McLaren being found guilty of spying on
                    Ferrari). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after
                    its purchase of Brawn GP, and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.
                </p>
                <p>During the 2009 season of Formula One, the sport was gripped by the FIA–FOTA dispute. The FIA
                    President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the following season, including an
                    optional budget cap for the teams;[39] teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted
                    greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings and an engine not subject to a rev
                    limiter.[39] The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such
                    technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with
                    the FIA. However, talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the exception of Williams and
                    Force India,[40][41] that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship series.</p>


                <p>Bernie Ecclestone, the former Chief executive of the Formula One Group
                    On 24 June, an agreement was reached between Formula One's governing body and the teams to prevent a
                    breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two
                    years; exact figures were not specified,[42] and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for
                    re-election to the FIA presidency in October.[43] Following further disagreements, after Max Mosley
                    suggested he would stand for re-election,[44] FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still
                    being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating they had been informed they were not
                    entered for the 2010 season,[45] and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked
                    out of the meeting.[46] On 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde
                    Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.</p>

                <p>To compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010
                    season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap'. Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus – which was led
                    by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing – the
                    first Spanish Formula One team; as well as Virgin Racing – Richard Branson's entry into the series
                    following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1
                    Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the
                    sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these
                    new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams – who did not have the budgets of the
                    midfield and top-order teams – ran around at the back of the field until they inevitably collapsed;
                    HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin then Marussia), having
                    survived falling into administration in 2014, went under at the end of 2016.</p>

                <p>A major rule shake-up in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally-aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre
                    turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the
                    championship's fourth engine manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule
                    shake-up, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and
                    teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. In 2015, Ferrari
                    was the only challenger to Mercedes, with Vettel taking victory in the three Grands Prix Mercedes
                    did not win.</p>

                <p>In the 2016 season, Haas joined the grid. The season began in dominant fashion for Nico Rosberg,
                    winning the first 4 Grands Prix. His charge was halted by Max Verstappen, who took his maiden win in
                    Spain in his debut race for Red Bull. After that, the reigning champion Lewis Hamilton decreased the
                    point gap between him and Rosberg to only one point, before taking the championship lead heading
                    into the summer break. Following the break, the 1–2 positioning remained constant until an engine
                    failure for Hamilton in Malaysia left Rosberg in a commanding lead that he would not relinquish in
                    the 5 remaining races. Having won the title by a mere 5 points, Rosberg retired from Formula One at
                    season's end, becoming the first driver since Alain Prost in 1993 to retire after winning the
                    Drivers' Championship.</p>


                <p>Renault returned as a team in 2016 (pictured with Jolyon Palmer)
                    Recent years have seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport. After Honda's return
                    as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 after buying back the Lotus
                    F1 team. In 2018, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors,
                    respectively. Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the 2019 season, while Racing Point
                    part-owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston
                    Martin for 2021. In August 2020, a new Concorde Agreement was signed by all ten F1 teams committing
                    them to the sport until 2025, including a $145M budget cap for car development to support equal
                    competition and sustainable development in the future.</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A
                    significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was
                    pushed back to 2022,[51] with constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a
                    token system limiting which parts could be modified was introduced.[52] The start of the 2020 season
                    was delayed by several months,[53] and both it and 2021 seasons were subject to several
                    postponements, cancellations and rescheduling of races due to the shifting restrictions on
                    international travel. Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel
                    present to maintain social distancing.[54]</p>
