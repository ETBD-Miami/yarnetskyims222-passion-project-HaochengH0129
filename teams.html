                        <h3>Team Profile</h3>
                        <p>For many, Ferrari and Formula 1 racing have become inseparable. The only team to have
                            competed in
                            every season since the world championship began, the Prancing Horse has grown from the
                            humble
                            dream of founder Enzo Ferrari to become one of the most iconic and recognised brands in the
                            world. Success came quickly through the likes of Alberto Ascari and John Surtees, and
                            continued
                            – in amongst leaner times – with Niki Lauda in the 1970s and then Michael Schumacher in the
                            2000s, when Ferrari claimed a then unprecedented five consecutive title doubles, securing
                            their
                            status as the most successful and decorated team in F1 history...</p>

                        <h4>2021</h4>
                        <p> Still no sign of a title challenge, but strong year-on-year improvement lifts them clear of
                            McLaren for P3 overall, with more than double their 2020 points tally. New arrival Carlos
                            Sainz outscores Charles Leclerc, the Spaniard taking four podiums to his team mate’s one.
                        </p>

                        <h4>2020</h4>
                        <P>Sink to their worst performance in four decades, failing to win a race, scoring just three
                            podiums and falling to sixth in the standings. Sebastian Vettel is told early on that his
                            contract will not be renewed for 2021, and it’s Charles Leclerc who secures 98 of the team’s
                            131 points.</p>
                        <h4>2019</h4>
                        <p>The pattern of recent years continues, as they fail to win a race until August’s Belgian GP,
                            despite being clear pre-season favourites and often having the quickest car. A tense (and at
                            times expensive) rivalry sees newcomer Charles Leclerc out-score veteran team mate Sebastian
                            Vettel, with two victories to the four-time champion’s one.</p>
