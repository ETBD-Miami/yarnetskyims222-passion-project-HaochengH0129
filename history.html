                <h1> The History Of Formula One</h1>

                <div class="background information">
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3 id="t1">The Start</h3>
                    <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of
                        the 1920s and
                        1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One
                        was a new
                        formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship races taking place that year.
                        The first
                        Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had
                        laid out rules
                        for a world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the
                        conflict, the
                        World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship
                        race took
                        place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. Giuseppe Farina, in his Alfa Romeo, won the
                        first World
                        Championship for Drivers in 1950, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However,
                        Fangio won
                        the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles
                        stood for 45
                        years until Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was interrupted
                        (after an
                        injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari.</p>

                    <p>A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to
                        compete
                        regularly, he was never able to win the world championship and has been described by The
                        Independent as "The
                        greatest driver to never win the world championship". In a seven-year span between 1955 and
                        1961, Moss
                        finished as championship runner-up four times and in third place the other three times. Fangio,
                        however, achieved the record of winning 24 of the 52 races he entered - a record that holds to
                        this day.
                        National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.
                        Non-championship Formula
                        One events were held by promoters for many years. However, due to the increasing cost of
                        competition, the
                        last of these occurred in 1983.</p>

                    <P>This period featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz,
                        and
                        Maserati. The first seasons featured pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with
                        narrow
                        tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953
                        World
                        Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to
                        concerns over the
                        lack of Formula One cars available. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5
                        litres
                        was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz introduced the advanced W196.
                        This featured
                        innovations such as desmodromic valves and fuel injection, as well as enclosed streamlined
                        bodywork.
                        Mercedes drivers won the championship for two years, before the team withdrew from all
                        motorsport in the
                        wake of the 1955 Le Mans disaster.</p>

                    <h3 id="t2">Technological Developments</h3>
                    <p> The first major technological development, Bugatti's re-introduction of mid-engined cars
                        (following
                        Ferdinand Porsche's pioneering Auto Unions of the 1930s), occurred with the Type 251, which was
                        unsuccessful. Australian Jack Brabham, world champion during 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved
                        the
                        mid-engined design's superiority. By 1961, all regular competitors had switched to mid-engined
                        cars. The
                        Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined F1 car to enter a world
                        championship
                        race. It was entered in the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that
                        year.</p>

                    <p> During 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the
                        traditional
                        space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the
                        introduction of
                        mid-engined cars. During 1968, Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship
                        on their
                        Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours in the 1968 South
                        African Grand Prix
                        on 1 January 1968, thus introducing sponsorship to the sport.[17] Five months later, Lotus as
                        the first
                        works team followed this example when they painted an Imperial Tobacco livery on their cars in
                        the 1968
                        Spanish Grand Prix.</p>

                    <p> Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils
                        during the
                        late 1960s. During the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics (previously used
                        on Jim
                        Hall's Chaparral 2J during 1970) that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased
                        cornering speeds.
                        The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As
                        a result,
                        extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension
                        virtually
                        solid. This meant that the drivers were depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount of
                        cushioning
                        of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.[18]</p>

                    <h3 id="t3">Big Businesses</h3>
                    <p>Beginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial
                        rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business
                        it now is.[19][20] When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the
                        Formula One Constructors' Association and during 1978, he became its president.[21] Previously,
                        the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually;
                        however, Ecclestone persuaded the teams to "hunt as a pack" through FOCA.[20] He offered Formula
                        One to circuit owners as a package, which they could take or leave. In return for the package,
                        almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.</p>
                    <p>The formation of the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) during 1979 set off the
                        FISA–FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with
                        FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations.[22] The Guardian said that Ecclestone
                        and Max Mosley "used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view". FOCA
                        threatened to establish a rival series, boycotted a Grand Prix and FISA withdrew its sanction
                        from races.[19] The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical
                        stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations.[23] Although FISA
                        asserted its right to the TV revenues, it handed the administration of those rights to FOCA.</p>
                    <p>FISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983.[25] By then, however, turbocharged
                        engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were
                        essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5
                        bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian
                        Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost
                        pressure limited to only 4.0 bar.[26] These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit
                        racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank
                        capacity in 1984, and boost pressures in 1988, before banning turbocharged engines completely in
                        1989</p>
                    <p>The development of electronic driver aids began during the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system
                        of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92.[28] By 1987, this system
                        had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year.
                        In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control
                        were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the
                        outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994 season. This
                        resulted in cars that were previously dependent on electronic aids becoming very "twitchy" and
                        difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they "proved
                        difficult to police effectively".</p>
                    <p>The teams signed a second Concorde Agreement during 1992 and a third in 1997.</p>
                    <p>On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham were also
                        being competitive during the early part of the 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with
                        Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won sixteen championships
                        (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford,
                        Honda, and Renault to also win sixteen titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The
                        rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during 1988 and
                        continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix
                        after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to
                        improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also
                        lost his life in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on
                        the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix,
                        where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying
                        nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have lost their lives, one
                        at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix,[31] the second at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix[31] and the
                        third at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.</p>

                    <p>Since the deaths of Senna and Ratzenberger, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule
                        changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all
                        the teams – most notably the changes introduced for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era
                        resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of
                        grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to
                        produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and
                        track. This, according to the FIA, was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.</p>
                    <p>Results were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers
                        clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the
                        tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking as these
                        devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars
                        from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the
                        track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder
                        compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in
                        times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.</p>

                    <p>Drivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the "Big Four",
                        won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008. The teams won every Constructors' Championship
                        from 1979 to 2008, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors'
                        Championship in every season between 1989 and 1997, and winning every race but one (the 1996
                        Monaco Grand Prix) between 1988 and 1997. Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the
                        cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens.
                        This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as
                        Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive,
                        but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.</p>
