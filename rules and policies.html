                    <p>A Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It begins with two free practice sessions on
                        Friday (except in Monaco, where Friday practices are moved to Thursday), and one free practice
                        on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays,
                        but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A
                        qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the
                        starting order for the race on Sunday.</p>

                    <p>Each driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate
                        tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend.</p>

                <div class="qualifying">
                    <h3 id="t2">Qualifying</h3>
                    <p>For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions;
                        drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order
                        determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid,
                        referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a 1-hour shootout. This approach
                        lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not
                        running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later
                        on.</p>

                    <p>Grids were generally limited to 26 cars – if the race had more entries, qualification would also
                        decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so
                        high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest
                        cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in
                        the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the
                        aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.</p>

                    <p>The current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as "knock-out" qualifying,
                        it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying
                        laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being "knocked out" of
                        qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions
                        set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as
                        they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's
                        fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of
                        that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars
                        eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the
                        championship.[59] Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest
                        five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the
                        fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards.
                        Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule
                        does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one
                        of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees
                        the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016
                        Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out
                        every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix
                        up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above
                        qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.</p>

                    <p>Each car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3
                        must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race.[60]
                        As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand
                        Prix,[61] whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free
                        tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at
                        the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or
                        current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering,
                        the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back
                        of the grid at the race steward's discretion.</p>

                    <p>2021 has seen the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race
                        weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying.</p>
                </div>

                <br />
                <hr />

                <div class="race">
                    <h3 id="t3">Race</h3>
                    <p>The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the
                        order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the car's lap in
                        formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground
                        provided they have fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the
                        condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction,
                        and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.</p>
                    <p>Once all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the
                        pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are
                        illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an
                        unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start
                        procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising their arm. If
                        this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed
                        from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous
                        conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car
                        if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy
                        rainfall. As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy
                        rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried
                        sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races
                        start behind the Safety Car.</p>

                    <p>Under normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line
                        having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red
                        flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours,
                        although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety
                        car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating
                        it, the red flag is deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is
                        resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane
                        (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was
                        shown).</p>

                    <p>In the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race
                        length was reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was
                        standardised to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989. However, street races like Monaco have
                        shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.</p>


                    <p>Drivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes
                        across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue
                        flag[64] telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car
                        is said to be "lapped" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the
                        race "one lap down". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A
                        driver who fails to finish a race, through mechanical problems, accident, or any other reason is
                        said to have retired from the race and is "Not Classified" in the results. However, if the
                        driver has completed more than 90% of the race distance, they will be classified.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to
                        2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop
                        strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different
                        durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race,
                        drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different
                        levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to
                        make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to
                        understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised
                        wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one "intermediate", for mild wet conditions, such as
                        after recent rain, one "full wet", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make
                        at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although
                        further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are
                        used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.</p>

                <div class="race director">
                    <h3 id="t4">Race Director</h3>
                    <p>This role involves generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in
                        parc fermé before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race.
                        As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in sorting disputes
                        amongst teams and drivers. Penalties, such as drive-through penalties (and stop-and-go
                        penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines can all be
                        handed out should parties break regulations. As of 2022, the race directors are Ninels Wittich
                        and Eduardo Freitas on an alternating basis, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor.</p>

                    <h3 id="t5">Safety Car</h3>
                    <p>In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race
                        officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers
                        following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not
                        permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on
                        circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure
                        a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the
                        race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates
                        until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a "rolling start". Pit
                        stops are permitted under the safety car. Since 2000, the main safety car driver has been German
                        ex-racing driver Bernd Mayländer.[66] On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits,
                        the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this
                        line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more. Mercedes-Benz supplies
                        Mercedes-AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin
                        supplies the Vantage to Formula One to use as the safety car, sharing the duty with
                        Mercedes-Benz.</p>

                    <h3 id="t6">Flags</h3>
                    <p>The format of the race has changed little through Formula One's history. The main changes have
                        revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver
                        would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate's car should theirs develop a problem – in
                        the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In
                        recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. Since
                        the 2010 season, refuelling – which was reintroduced in 1994 – has not been allowed, to
                        encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of
                        tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track.
                        The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red
                        flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television
                        audience.</p>
