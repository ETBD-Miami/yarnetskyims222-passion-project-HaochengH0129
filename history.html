    <h1> The History Of Formula One</h1>

    <div class="background information">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>The Start</h3>
        <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and
            1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One was a new
            formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship races taking place that year. The first
            Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules
            for a world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the
            World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship race took
            place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. Giuseppe Farina, in his Alfa Romeo, won the first World
            Championship for Drivers in 1950, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio won
            the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles stood for 45
            years until Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was interrupted (after an
            injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari.</p>

        <p>A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to compete
            regularly, he was never able to win the world championship and has been described by The Independent as "The
            greatest driver to never win the world championship". In a seven-year span between 1955 and 1961, Moss
            finished as championship runner-up four times and in third place the other three times. Fangio,
            however, achieved the record of winning 24 of the 52 races he entered - a record that holds to this day.
            National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula
            One events were held by promoters for many years. However, due to the increasing cost of competition, the
            last of these occurred in 1983.</p>

        <P>This period featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and
            Maserati. The first seasons featured pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with narrow
            tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 World
            Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the
            lack of Formula One cars available. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres
            was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz introduced the advanced W196. This featured
            innovations such as desmodromic valves and fuel injection, as well as enclosed streamlined bodywork.
            Mercedes drivers won the championship for two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport in the
            wake of the 1955 Le Mans disaster.</p>

        <h3>Technological Developments</h3>
        <p> The first major technological development, Bugatti's re-introduction of mid-engined cars (following
            Ferdinand Porsche's pioneering Auto Unions of the 1930s), occurred with the Type 251, which was
            unsuccessful. Australian Jack Brabham, world champion during 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the
            mid-engined design's superiority. By 1961, all regular competitors had switched to mid-engined cars. The
            Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined F1 car to enter a world championship
            race. It was entered in the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.</p>

        <p> During 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional
            space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of
            mid-engined cars. During 1968, Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on their
            Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours in the 1968 South African Grand Prix
            on 1 January 1968, thus introducing sponsorship to the sport.[17] Five months later, Lotus as the first
            works team followed this example when they painted an Imperial Tobacco livery on their cars in the 1968
            Spanish Grand Prix.</p>

        <p> Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the
            late 1960s. During the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics (previously used on Jim
            Hall's Chaparral 2J during 1970) that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds.
            The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result,
            extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually
            solid. This meant that the drivers were depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning
            of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.[18]</p>
