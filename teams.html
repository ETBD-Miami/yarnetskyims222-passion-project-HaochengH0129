                            <h3>Team Profile</h3>
                            <p>For many, Ferrari and Formula 1 racing have become inseparable. The only team to have
                                competed in
                                every season since the world championship began, the Prancing Horse has grown from the
                                humble
                                dream of founder Enzo Ferrari to become one of the most iconic and recognised brands in
                                the
                                world. Success came quickly through the likes of Alberto Ascari and John Surtees, and
                                continued
                                – in amongst leaner times – with Niki Lauda in the 1970s and then Michael Schumacher in
                                the
                                2000s, when Ferrari claimed a then unprecedented five consecutive title doubles,
                                securing
                                their
                                status as the most successful and decorated team in F1 history...</p>

                            <h4>2021</h4>
                            <p> Still no sign of a title challenge, but strong year-on-year improvement lifts them clear
                                of
                                McLaren for P3 overall, with more than double their 2020 points tally. New arrival
                                Carlos
                                Sainz outscores Charles Leclerc, the Spaniard taking four podiums to his team mate’s
                                one.
                            </p>

                            <h4>2020</h4>
                            <P>Sink to their worst performance in four decades, failing to win a race, scoring just
                                three
                                podiums and falling to sixth in the standings. Sebastian Vettel is told early on that
                                his
                                contract will not be renewed for 2021, and it’s Charles Leclerc who secures 98 of the
                                team’s
                                131 points.</p>
                            <h4>2019</h4>
                            <p>The pattern of recent years continues, as they fail to win a race until August’s Belgian
                                GP,
                                despite being clear pre-season favourites and often having the quickest car. A tense
                                (and at
                                times expensive) rivalry sees newcomer Charles Leclerc out-score veteran team mate
                                Sebastian
                                Vettel, with two victories to the four-time champion’s one.</p>

                                <h3>Team Profile</h3>
                                <p>Mercedes’ modern F1 revival started with the creation of a works squad for 2010 - the
                                    platform for a meteoric rise up the Grand Prix order. The team generated huge
                                    excitement from the off with the sensational return of Michael Schumacher, but
                                    headlines soon followed on track: three podiums in their debut season, all via Nico
                                    Rosberg - who then claimed a breakthrough pole/victory double at China in 2012. The
                                    following season he was paired with Lewis Hamilton, the duo going on to stage some
                                    epic title battles as the Silver Arrows swept all before them to become one of the
                                    most dominant forces of the modern F1 era. And with Hamilton now partnered by steely
                                    Finn Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes remain very much the team to beat…</p>

                                <h4>2021</h4>
                                <p> Face the biggest challenge yet to their dominance of the turbo-hybrid. Lewis
                                    Hamilton loses his drivers’ crown to Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, despite winning
                                    eight races, as the team just about hang on to the constructors’ title, which they
                                    retain for an eighth successive season.
                                </p>

                                <h4>2020</h4>
                                <P>Just when you think they can’t get any better, Mercedes – and in particular Lewis
                                    Hamilton – step it up another gear. The reigning champion wins 11 races and smashes
                                    records galore en route to a Schumacher-equalling seventh drivers' title, despite
                                    missing a round with Covid-19. Add two wins for Valtteri Bottas and it’s another
                                    dominant double crown for the Silver Arrows.</p>
                                <h4>2019</h4>
                                <p>Start the season with an unprecedented five one-two victories, and follow it up with
                                    a further 10 wins, thus securing their sixth title double on the bounce. All-round
                                    teamwork, rather than outright pace, is often the key to success. Valtteri Bottas
                                    ups his game, meaning Lewis Hamilton has to work hard to secure his sixth drivers’
                                    crown, bringing the Brit tantalising close to matching Michael Schumacher’s all-time
                                    record.</p>
